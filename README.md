Certainly! Here is the action plan translated into English:

### **Action Plan for Migrating Microservices to New Java and Spring Boot Versions**

#### **1. Preliminary Analysis and Planning**

1.1. **Inventory of Microservices**
   - List all microservices to be migrated.
   - Identify dependencies between the microservices.
   - Document the current versions of Java, Spring Boot, and other dependencies.

1.2. **Risk Assessment**
   - Identify potential risks, such as incompatibilities with certain libraries or performance impacts.
   - Assess the impact of migration on other services and integrated systems.

1.3. **Prioritization**
   - Prioritize microservices based on their criticality to the business.
   - Start by migrating one or two non-critical microservices to test the process.

1.4. **Resources and Training**
   - Ensure that the necessary resources (testing and pre-production environments) are available.
   - Plan training or information sessions on the new versions of Java and Spring Boot for the team.

#### **2. Environment Migration and Code Modifications**

2.1. **Environment Migration**
   - **Update Environments**: Prepare development, testing, and production environments for the new versions of Java and Spring Boot.
   - **Configuration Management Strategy**: Update configuration files for each microservice, ensuring compatibility with the new versions.

2.2. **Code Modifications**
   - **Code Analysis**: Identify code parts affected by the migration (deprecated APIs, changes in Spring Boot).
   - **Dependency Updates**: Update `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` to use the latest versions of Spring Boot and Java.
   - **Code Refactoring**: Adapt the code to eliminate dependencies on deprecated APIs and leverage new features.
   - **Test Updates**: Update unit and integration tests to cover the changes.

#### **3. Deployment Strategy**

3.1. **Progressive Deployment**
   - **Canary Deployment**: Deploy new versions on a small percentage of instances to limit impact in case of issues.
   - **Blue-Green Deployment**: Use a Blue-Green deployment strategy to switch production environments without service interruption.
   - **Step-by-Step Deployment**: Gradually deploy microservices, starting with the least critical ones.

3.2. **Monitoring and Validation**
   - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Implement detailed monitoring to track performance and service health after deployment.
   - **Post-Deployment Analysis**: Review logs, metrics, and feedback to detect and correct issues.
   - **Functional Validation**: Run end-to-end tests to ensure all critical functionalities work as expected.

#### **4. Risk Management and Rollback Plan**

4.1. **Rollback Plan**
   - **Prepare a Rollback Plan**: Document a strategy to revert to the previous version in case of major issues during migration.
   - **Backups and Snapshots**: Take snapshots of production environments and back up databases before initiating the migration.

4.2. **Documentation and Communication**
   - **Continuous Documentation**: Update technical documentation to reflect new versions and code changes.
   - **Communication**: Regularly inform stakeholders (development team, operations teams, management) about the migration status.

#### **5. Finalization and Optimization**

5.1. **Post-Migration Optimization**
   - **Performance Analysis**: Monitor microservice performance after migration and optimize as needed.
   - **Cost Optimization**: Analyze costs associated with the new versions and adjust allocated resources if necessary.

5.2. **Retrospective and Continuous Improvement**
   - **Migration Evaluation**: Conduct a retrospective to evaluate what worked well and what could be improved for future migrations.
   - **Continuous Learning**: Leverage lessons learned to enhance deployment and microservice management processes.

#### **6. Planning Future Migrations**
   - **Establish a Regular Update Cycle: Set up a regular update schedule to avoid large-scale migrations and keep microservices up to date.
